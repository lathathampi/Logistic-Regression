Support Vector Regression (SVR) on Tips Dataset
This project demonstrates how to use Support Vector Regression (SVR) to predict restaurant total bills using the well-known Tips dataset. It includes preprocessing (label + one-hot encoding), model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.

📚 Dataset Overview
The Tips dataset from Seaborn includes information about meals in a restaurant and the corresponding tips. It contains both numerical and categorical variables.

Features:

total_bill: Total cost of the meal (target)
tip: Tip amount
sex: Gender of the customer (Male/Female)
smoker: Whether the customer smokes (Yes/No)
day: Day of the week
time: Time of day (Lunch/Dinner)
size: Number of people in the party
🧪 Libraries Used
pandas
numpy
seaborn
scikit-learn (SVR, GridSearchCV, LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder, ColumnTransformer)
matplotlib or seaborn (for optional visualizations)
🧼 Data Preprocessing
🔄 Feature Encoding
Label Encoding: Applied to binary categorical features (sex, smoker, time)
One-Hot Encoding: Applied to day using ColumnTransformer with drop='first' to avoid multicollinearity
📊 Feature and Target Separation
X = ['tip', 'sex', 'smoker', 'day', 'time', 'size']
y = total_bill
✂️ Train-Test Split
Performed before encoding to avoid data leakage
test_size=0.2, random_state=42
🤖 Model: Support Vector Regression (SVR)
✅ Training
Model: SVR()
Fitted on encoded training data
Evaluated on test set
📈 Metrics
Initial SVR Results:

R-squared Score: 0.5502
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 4.41
🔍 Hyperparameter Tuning
Using GridSearchCV

✅ Conclusion
This project showcases the application of SVR on real-world-like data, along with:

Proper feature engineering (label + one-hot encoding)
Avoiding data leakage
Hyperparameter tuning for optimization While performance could still be improved with more complex models or feature engineering, this provides a strong foundation for regression modeling with scikit-learn.
